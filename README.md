# A-Study-of-a-Job-Portal-s-Impact-on-Female-Employment-Rates

This study aims to investigate the impact of a job portal on female employment rates. Job portals have become an increasingly popular tool for connecting job seekers with potential employers, providing a platform for job listings, resume uploads, and communication between candidates and recruiters. However, the extent to which job portals contribute to improving female employment rates remains underexplored. This study seeks to fill this gap by examining the influence of a specific job portal on female employment, identifying potential barriers and opportunities for women in the labor market.
